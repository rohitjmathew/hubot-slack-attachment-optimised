# Re-enable `slack-attachment` in [hubot-slack][hubot-slack]
When Slack introduced version 3 of their [hubot-slack][hubot-slack] adapter the old `slack-attachment` was removed due to [constraints in the RTM API](https://github.com/slackhq/hubot-slack/issues/108). This is a personalised implementation of [hubot-slack-attachment](https://github.com/inkel/hubot-slack-attachment).

This module attempts to reintroduce the event using [Incoming Webhooks][incoming] to somehow replicate the lost feature.

To use again `slack-attachment` events, just run the following in your hubot repository:

```
npm install hubot-slack-attachment-optimised --save
```

And then add `hubot-slack-attachment-optimised` to `external-scripts.json`.

Last but not least, you need to add the environment variable `HUBOT_SLACK_INCOMING_WEBHOOK` to the URL for the new [incoming webhook][incoming] you've just defined.

## Usage

Emit a `slack.attachment` event with the following parameters:

```coffee
robot.emit 'slack.attachment',
  message: msg.message
  content:
    # see https://api.slack.com/docs/attachments
    text: "Attachment text"
    fallback: "Attachment fallback"
    fields: [{
      title: "Field title"
      value: "Field value"
    }]
  channel: "#general" # optional, defaults to message.room
  username: "foobot" # optional, defaults to robot.name
  icon_url: "..." # optional
  icon_emoji: "..." # optional
```

## Known Issues

* The user name sending the attachment will be `#{robot.name} (bot)`, so if your bot is named `hubot` it will appear as `hubot (bot)`
